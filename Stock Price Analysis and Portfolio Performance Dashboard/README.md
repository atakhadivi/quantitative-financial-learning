# Stock Price Analysis and Portfolio Performance Dashboard

### A step-by-step checklist for building the project

---

## Tasks

### 1. Setup Environment and Dependencies
- [x] Install Python 3.8+ and Jupyter Notebook.
- [x] Create a virtual environment:  
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
Install required packages:

bash
- [x] pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib plotly streamlit dash
- [x] Initialize Git repository and create folders: data/raw, data/processed, notebooks, scripts.

2. Fetch and Clean Historical Stock Data
- [x] Write Python script to fetch data for stocks (e.g., AAPL, GOOG) and S&P 500 (SPY) using yfinance.

- [x] Save raw data to data/raw/ as CSV files.

Clean data:

- [x] Handle missing values (forward-fill or drop).

Calculate daily returns and log returns.

Save cleaned data to data/processed/.

3. Calculate Metrics and Risk Analysis
Compute technical indicators:

20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.

Rolling volatility (standard deviation).

Calculate risk metrics:

Annualized Sharpe ratio.

Maximum drawdown.

Compare portfolio performance against S&P 500:

Cumulative returns over time.

Relative performance visualization.

4. Data Visualization
Create Matplotlib plots:

Price trends with moving averages.

Volatility and drawdown charts.

Build interactive Plotly visualizations:

Candlestick charts.

Portfolio vs. benchmark comparison subplots.

Save plots to results/figures/.

5. Build Interactive Dashboard
Create Streamlit/Dash app (app.py):

Add widgets for stock selection and date range.

Display interactive charts and risk metrics.

Integrate data loading and dynamic updates.

Test locally:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
6. Documentation and GitHub Setup
Write Jupyter notebooks:

data_fetching_cleaning.ipynb

portfolio_analysis.ipynb

Add requirements.txt with dependencies.

Update this README.md with setup/usage instructions.

Add MIT License file.

Optional Advanced Tasks
Implement Sortino ratio.

Deploy dashboard to Streamlit Cloud/Heroku.

Add machine learning for return predictions.
